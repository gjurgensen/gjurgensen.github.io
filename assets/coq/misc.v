(* This is not exactly a tutorial. A tutorial is focused on practical skills, and 
   there are many high quality Coq tutorials available. I call it an "exploration" 
   because I am trying to dig deeper off the beaten path. It also implies that I 
   myself am exploring personally uncharted territories. I am delving into topics 
   that I myself wish to know more about, and sketching a map as I go that I hope 
   may make someone else's journey more efficient in the future.

   I am not some omniscient master of the land. I am delving into topics
   that I myself wish to know more about, and sketching a map as I go, marking down 
   the monuments and the dead ends, and hoping that some other explorers find my 
   map helpful.

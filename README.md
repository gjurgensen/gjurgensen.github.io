My personal website: https://grantjurgensen.com.

This website is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), for which I've rolled my own theme.

I use a custom version of Hugo, because I wanted to use custom code lexers for less popular languages, without taking the time to fully polish and test the lexers in order to submit them for inclusion to the upstream [chroma](https://github.com/alecthomas/chroma) project, and then have to wait for that version to reach Hugo.
